<h1 align='center'> Introduction to Pytorch </h1>
<br>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea behind this repository is that we are going to explore how to build AI systems/models conduct experiments on Pytorch from scratch with almost 0 idea about what pytorch itself is. I have followed most of the references and examples from many sources mainly <br>

<h2> 1.0. Introduction to Pytorch.</h2><br>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the basic Introduction I have divided the portion into 2 different notebooks ranging from very basics understanding of tensors to Matrix Multiplication which is what happens behind the scenes for Neural Networks and many more. You can Learn all these as: <br></p>

<h2> 2.0 Understanding the Work Flow of ML Pipelines </h2>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this portion we learn about how workflow of ML pipeline is carried out and what should be done to follow a standard framework for understanding AI and building AI Frameworks: <br></p>
